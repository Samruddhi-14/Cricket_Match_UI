This project features a user interface designed to display comprehensive cricket match scores and detailed player performance metrics. It provides data on match outcomes, indicating the winning and losing teams, along with in-depth statistics for each player. The UI presents key performance parameters such as:

- **Player Information:** Name, role (batsman/bowler)
- **Batting Metrics:** Runs scored, balls faced, batting strike rate
- **Bowling Metrics:** Balls bowled, wickets taken (if applicable)

While not a real-time project, this interface is aimed at offering a clear and organized way to review and analyze match data after the event, making it a useful tool for cricket enthusiasts and analysts alike.
